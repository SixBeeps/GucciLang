# GucciLang
Esoteric programming language built around .NET

##First of all, wth?
Yes. This *is* in reference to the rap song by Lil Pump. Again, I did say this was esoteric, right?

##Okay then. How does it work?
Well, each line of code will have "gucci gang" somewhere. The action it performs depends on how many times the interpreter finds the string "gucci gang" on the line. For instance, "gucci gang guuuuci gang gucci gng gucci gang" only has "gucci gang" written twice, so it will run as if "gucci gang gucci gang" were written.
One gucci gang (gg) adds one to a variable.
Two gg's subtract one from the variable.
Three gg's prints out the variable in Unicode format to the screen.
Four gg's reads the users input on the keyboard and stores it in the variable.
Five gg's checks to see if the variable is 0. If it is, the program will stop. However, if it isn't, then the code will just skip that line of code.

##Gotcha. How do I use it?
After downloading the interpreter (Program.cs) and unzipping it from its .zip file, you must use the "Open With" file dialog in order to interpret a file. **GucciLang uses the .gucci file extention.** Just save the .gucci file in your standard text editor. Right-click on the code file and choose "Open With..." From there, locate Program.cs in the GucciLang solution that you unzipped earlier.
**Protip:** If you leave "Always open this type of file using this program" or something along the lines of that, .gucci files will always open in the GucciLang interpreter.

##I don't get it.
Try looking through the example file(s) in the unzipped folder. Another website that might come in handy is https://unicode-table.com/en/, but make sure you use the decimial form of each character.
